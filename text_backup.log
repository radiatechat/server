[infernity]: client or commands?
[dig
in]: oh i forgot to wait for you to send the message
[infernity]: actually digin
[dig
in]: time travel
[infernity]: you could make the fronteng in like python

[dig
in]: its still funny to me that
[dig
in]: the like only good way to communicate between programs on the same computer
[infernity]: tell me what you want me to add on backend and ill add it
[dig
in]: is to just use network protocols
[infernity]: i mean it works fairly well
[dig
in]: true but youd think thered be an easier way since
[dig
in]: yknow
[dig
in]: its the same computer
[infernity]: true but the only thing better than perfect is standardized
[dig
in]: ig
[infernity]: anyway
[dig
in]: anyway python isnt even really good at doing ui
[infernity]: yeah you could make the frontend and i make the backend
[dig
in]: well pygame
[dig
